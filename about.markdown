My name is Nathaniel Keplinger, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in data science from the Colorado School of Mines. I graduated in May 2021 from Trinity University with a Bachelor's of science with majors in Physics and Chinese language. I believe in the power of sound, ethically sourced data to bring positive change. As all facets of our lives become increasingly digitally connected, the opportunity to use this abundance of new data is exciting and empowering. Data that enables smarter city infrastucture, more efficient energy grids, revolutionary medicine, and profound social insights are just around the corner; I want to be part of a **smarter, data-driven** world.

Outside of school work, I enjoy playing chess, going on long walks, enjoying the outdoors, and brushing up on my Mandarin.

I currently live in Golden, Colorado USA.

如果你的中文很流利，欢迎随时联系我。 我希望能不断提高我的中文水平。我曾经在2019年在哈尔滨学习过中文。虽这段访问中国的经历给我留下了深刻的印象，不过离开中国后，我的中文能力在逐渐退化。在下一阶段，我不仅想学好计算机课程，我还想努力提高我的中文水平。

路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。
