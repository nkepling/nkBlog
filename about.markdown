My name is Nathaniel Keplinger and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in data science from the Colorado School of Mines. I gradauted in May 2021 from Trinity University with a Bachelor's of science with majors in Physics and Chinese language. I believe in the power of good ethically sourced data to bring postitive change. As all facets of our lives become increasingly digitally connected, the opprotunity to use this abundance new data is exciting and empowering. Data that enables smarter city infrusture, more effiicient energy grids, revolutionary medicine and profound social insights are just around the corner; I want to be part of a **smarter, data-driven** world.

Outside of school work, I enjoy playing chess, going on long walks, enjoying the outdoors, and brushing upon on my Mandarin. 
    
I currenly live in Golden, Colorado USA.

如果你会说流利的中文，请联系我! 我要提高我的中文的水平。我二零一九年去国哈尔滨学习中文。虽然我的访问中国的经历对我有很深刻的影响，我在慢慢遗忘我的中文。在下个功课我希望继续用我的中文除了计算机科学的功课。
