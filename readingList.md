## 2021

### October

#### When Breath Becomes Air *Paul Kalanithi*

A moving memior that reframes your relationship to both time and death.

### September

#### The Defining Decade *by Meg Jay*

This is one of those books that just gives you a new perspective on life and your twenties. As a twenty something who natuaraly feels overwhelmed with the enormity of the future, I reccomend this book to all in their twenties "looking to figure things out."
