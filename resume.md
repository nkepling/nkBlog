# Research Experience
**Department of Physics and Astronomy, Trinity University, San Antonio TX**  *August 2019 – May 2021* 

Lead a project analyzing the acoustic spectra of various oboe sound files.
- Wrote MATLAB code to window the audio files, take Fourier transforms, locate harmonics of the spectrum and their peaks, and other algorithms to better understand how the timbre of an oboe presents itself in the acoustic spectra. These acoustic features can be leveraged for machine learning purposes.
- Quantified and located the portions of the acoustic spectra that contribute classify various oboes.

Modeled quantum particles in a project by deriving a group-theoretical description for the permutation symmetries of four ultracold atoms
- Worked to derive a hyper-spherical representation for the four-particle permutation group.
